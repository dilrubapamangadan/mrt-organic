            MRT Organic essential oils are produced from plants that are grown
            without the use of pesticides or herbicides in accordance with
            organic agricultural standards. In addition, there are oils
            distilled from wild-crafted plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            A careful distillation process and Organic Agricultural standards
            ensure the quality of Organic Essential oils are superior to Non
            Organic Oil and its therapeutic values are excellent than
            conventional oils.

<h3 class="font-bold mb-3">Why are organic oils superior to non-organic Oils?</h3>
<p>Essential oils are highly concentrated plant medicines. As such, they are 
subject to retaining high concentrations of contaminants if the plants they 
are derived from are grown with chemical agricultural methods. When you think 
about residues in this way, the benefits for those using organic oils vs. non 
organic oils is fairly obvious.</p>
<p>Many aroma therapists prefer to use organic essential oils in their clinical treatments because 
they believe organic agriculture yields oils that are more therapeutically active than their non-organic 
counterparts. The lack of pesticide residues is also a major
 benefit when using organic essential oils since these unwanted toxic chemicals have far-reaching effects on our bodies, wildlife, and the environment.</p>
